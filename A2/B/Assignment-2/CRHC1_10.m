function [Z,VN]=CRHC1_10(A,B,N,Q,R,Pf,F1,G1,h1,F2,G2,h2,x0)
%% A and B are the system matrices when x(k+1)=Ax(k)+Bu(k)
%% Q, R, and Pf are the gains in the cost function
%% N is the length of the horizon
%% Z is the vector of optimal variables and VN is the cost function 
%% F1, G1, h1, F2, G2, h2 are constraint matrices
%% x0 is the initial condition
